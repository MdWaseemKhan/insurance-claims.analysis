INSIGHTS FROM THE DATA:

        * Finding 1 - Grouped claims by vehicle class. Luxury vehicles = Associated with higher claims (3x more than sedan/sports car). 
        We need to re-check our premium. Are we charging them enough as it's more likely to affect the company's profitability.
        
        * Finding 2 - GEOGRAPHIC RISK - IDENTIFY HIGH COST REGIONS: 
        Nevada has the highest severity per major incident, but the cost variance across states is minimal, suggesting a consistent pricing model across West coast (USA).
        
        * Finding 3 - REVENUE ATTRIBUTION BY CHANNEL: Interestingly, traditional channels - AGENTS/BRANCH bring in more rvenue & more volume (> 60%) than digital channels.
        
        * Finding 4 - PROFITABILITY DRIVER - EDUCATION DISCOUNT: 
        There's DIRECT CORRELATION b/w education lvl & claims - claim cost declines as education level increases - i.e., more educated policyholders may be more responsible or lower-risk
        
        * Finding 5 - Identified Most Valuable Customers. They generate 100% profit margin but claim very less. We could offer these segments RETENTION OFFERS, so we don't lose them to a competitor.

        * Finding 6 - DEMOGRAPHIC VALIDATION & PRICING STRATEGY: Men have higher claims than women. We could consider premium pricing strategies based on gender.
